Hi Santa!

The IRFS Secret Santa draw for 2013 has been made, and <%= count %> happy
people will be receiving secret presents at the Christmas lunch.


  You (<%= santa.display_name %>) are Santa for:  <%= santee.display_name %>


- Try to spend about a fiver on your gift.

- Tacky gifts are allowed, maybe even encouraged!

- Bring in your present -- wrapped and named -- next Monday or Tuesday,
  when there will be a bag to deposit it before the lunch.

Ho ho ho!

P.S. If you don't know much about your Santee, don't worry! Maybe
they've got a bio on the R&D website:
